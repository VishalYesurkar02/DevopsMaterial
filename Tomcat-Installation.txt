Install and configuration steps of apache tomcat in unix:

-install java 1.8* then install zip  from tomcat server and follow the below steps:
 
To install java 
https://www.java.com/en/download/win10.jsp

To install the JDK software, do the following:
a.	Go to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp.
b.	Select the appropriate JDK version and click Download.
The JDK software is installed on your computer in the default location; for example, at /usr/jdk/jdk1.6.0_02. You can change this location.
2.	To set JAVA_HOME, do one of the following:
o	For Korn and bash shells, run the following commands:
export JAVA_HOME=jdk-install-dir
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
o	For the bourne shell, run the following commands:
JAVA_HOME=jdk-install-dir
export JAVA_HOME
PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export PATH
o	For the C shell, run the following commands:
setenv JAVA_HOME jdk-install-dir
setenv PATH $JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
3.	Change the permissions to enable you to run the GlassFish ESB Installer by running the following command:
chmod 755 JavaCAPS.bin


Download, install and configure Tomcat 7
We are going to download and install Tomcat 7 in the /usr/share directory by running the following two commands:
wget http://ftp.cixug.es/apache/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.42/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.42.tar.gz
tar zxpvf apache-tomcat-7.0.42.tar.gz

To configure Tomcat to launch automatically create a file called tomcat in the directory /etc/rc.d/init.d/ with the following contents:
!/bin/sh
# Tomcat init script for Linux.
#
# chkconfig: 2345 96 14
# description: The Apache Tomcat servlet/JSP container.
JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_40/
CATALINA_HOME=/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.42
export JAVA_HOME CATALINA_HOME
exec $CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh $*

chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/init.d/tomcat
chkconfig --level 2345 tomcat on


Now we need to set up the Tomcat users. This will allow access to the Manger Console in the Tomcat interface. The users are configured in a file called tomcat-users.xml which is stored in the apache-tomcat-7.0.42/config directory. Open this file using nano and edit the user permissions as below, changing the password as appropriate:
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
<role rolename="manager-status"/>
<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="**********" 
  roles="manager-gui,manager-status,admin-gui"/>
<user username="tomcattools" password="**********"/>

Another way
The following displays:
 
Figure 1: OpenL Tablets package is added
6.	If some sh files are not executable, enter the following command:
chmod +x ./*.sh
7.	Run the sturtup.sh file:
sh ./startup.sh
8.	In the browser, enter the following URL: http://localhost:8080
If the installation completed successfully, the Apache Tomcat welcome screen appears. The next thing to be done is to configure JVM options for Tomcat.
